# Ubisoft A/B Testing

I found our in class example of A/B testing to be quite compelling, and I wanted to find other examples where A/B testing was used to optimize user experience. One example I came across while browsing is Ubisoft, a gaming company that leveraged A/B testing to improve its purchasing experience.

Specifically, in this example, Ubisoft wanted to improve its buy page for one of their popular franchises *For Honor*. To search for areas to improve, Ubisoft collected visitor data using heatmaps, scrollmaps, clickmaps, and surveys. Using this data, the design teams hypothesized that the additionally scrolling required to navigate through multiple options (game editions, platforms, and consoles) in the buy page was causing friction and resulting in lost conversions. This lead them to the idea the layout needed simplification to improve the purchasing experience. 

With this Hypothesis, they then set up an A/B test. The new purchasing page removed the vertical scroll and had all important elements, edition selection, console preference, and the order button, at the top of the left column. This made the page easier to navigate and sped up the decision-making process. Notably, the test was also run during the holiday season where Ubisoft's platform had a 60% increase in visitors, improving the gathered metrics. 

The new layout significantly increased conversions, resulting in a 12% jump in lead generation rates (from 38% to 50%). This also lead to Ubisoft putting resources into A/B testing other products. 

For me, Ubisoft's example really emphasizes how important user testing can be. By gathering insights directly from users and iteratively testing new ideas, developers can make informed decisions to increase engagement, conversions, and of course, revenue.
