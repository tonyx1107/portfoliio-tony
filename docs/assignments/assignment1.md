# Assignment 1: Social Media Needfinding

## Interview Plan
**Hunch** - I want to explore how older generations engage with social media, as many platforms today seem heavily focused on youth-oriented entertainment. This may leave mature audiences disengaged, and I'd like to understand their needs and preferences better.

**Interviewees** - Based on my hunch, I plan to interview individuals from my parents' generation or older. This includes one of my parents, who will bring a perspective different from mine in terms of both age and cultural background, having spent many decades in China compared to my experience growing up in the U.S. Through these interviews, I hope to gain insight into their motivations for using social media, the features they find valuable, and any aspects of platforms that may deter their use. This will help explore how current platforms align (or fail to align) with the needs of more mature, diverse users.

**Preprepared Questions:** 
1. Where are you from? 
    - Can you tell me about your family background? 
2. Do you have kids? 
    - What social media do they use?
    - How do you feel about the platforms they use? 
3. What social media platforms do you use? 
    - What’s your most recent memory of using this platform? 
    - What features do you find to be the most valuable on this platform? 
    - Is there anything that bothers you when you use this platform? 
4. Are you familiar with any of these platforms, and how do you feel about them? 
    - Tiktok, Instagram, Snapchat, BeReal, Twitter (popular among younger generation) 

## Interview Report 
**Mrs. Tian** 

I interviewed my mother, who currently lives in Shanghai, about her social media use. She gave many details about WeChat and Little Red Book (Xiaohongshu), which are the two social media platforms she is most familiar with. For her, WeChat is primarily a communication tool, allowing her to easily stay connected with friends and family who are far away. She also participates in WeChat parent groups which keep her in loop about school events. She highlighted the convenience of WeChat’s file-sharing capabilities, video calling, and its ability to send important documents like PDFs and videos. I assumed that WeChat’s dozens of different features would be too distracting for my mother, but contrary to my belief, the platform’s all-in-one functionality was actually highly appreciated, having features like paying bills and ordering taxis. “It’s convenient that if I want to buy your grandparents fruits, I can just send the shopping link in the WeChat group chat, and I can even buy the fruits on WeChat”. However, she expressed frustration with the prevalence of ads in WeChat Moments and reels, and noted that sharing information with multiple people is cumbersome, as it requires the creation of different groups. When asked why she doesn’t use other platforms, she stated that WeChat is simply the only platform that people in China use. 

My mother also uses Little Red Book for gathering useful information such as vacation guides, visa tips, and even more practical advice like opening coconuts. While she appreciates this aspect of the platform, she voiced concern that it is becoming too similar to TikTok, which she dislikes. Overall, her usage of social media revolves around practical needs like communication and accessing valuable information, with entertainment or passive browsing being a much lower priority as expected. In fact, when asked about TikTok, she thought that it was a “good way to kill time”, and nothing more. 

**Mr. Wasuwanich**

I interviewed Mr. Wasuwanich, a Thai dad who migrated to Florida over two decades ago. He shared that he doesn’t use social media extensively and instead relies on news sources for most of his information. "Does news count?" he asked, highlighting that his primary form of digital engagement comes from reading articles rather than engaging in social platforms. His occasional social media use includes Facebook and Line. He checks Facebook about once a week. He uses Facebook primarily to “Gather information from the UPenn parent group”, and Line to communicate with family in Thailand, stating, “Line is prominent in Thailand,” and that it’s his go-to for texting relatives and seeing occasional updates.

Regarding Facebook, he expressed a general disinterest, saying, “I don’t really use [it] because I don’t know people on Facebook.” He also found the platform cluttered, with too many ads and irrelevant posts from mutuals. "It’s too much," he commented, noting that excessive ads and features like Facebook Dating and Marketplace detract from the platform’s appeal at least to him. When discussing his use of Line, he mentioned, “I only use it for practicality,” emphasizing his preference for text messages or phone calls, which he finds simpler and more direct. Additionally, he shared a preference for physical newspapers, remarking that he enjoys the “nostalgic” experience of flipping through a paper, though cost has led him to rely on his children’s Wall Street Journal subscription for financial news. Overall, his social media use remains minimal, driven by practicality and a desire for relevant information, with little interest in the modern features of today’s platforms, noticeably similar to my mother. 

## Design Opportunities 
1. **Integrated News and Information Platforms:** Both interviewees expressed a desire for practical, information-rich experiences. Mr. Wasuwanich was focused on financial news, while my mother used social platforms like Little Red Book to find travel guides and practical tips. There is an opportunity to design a social media platform that seamlessly integrates news, expert advice, and useful tips into a feed that caters specifically to mature users.
2. **Parent-Centered Group Communication:** A design opportunity exists to create a platform for parents, especially those with children in university, to easily form groups based on shared needs—like university updates or support groups—without cultural or regional limitations. Currently, it seems that cultural biases in social media use may prevent certain cultural groups from connecting with different groups (Chinese parents tend to stay on WeChat which no other cultures really use). Having a dedicated platform may help parents to connect with a more diverse group. 
3. **Toggle Features:** While my mother seemed to enjoy the many features that WeChat provides, Mr. Wasuwanich showed discontent towards the large number of features on Facebook. Giving users the choice to toggle certain features in their platform could improve user experience, eliminating unnecessary clutter. 
4. **Reduced Advertisement Feature:** Especially for users who intend to use the platform for productive purposes (communication and news), a "minimal ad mode" specifically applied to productive purposes such as news may be helpful for the overall experience. Both interviewees expressed their annoyance at the large amounts of ads they have faced in their social media experience. 

## Raw Notes 
**Mrs. Tian**
- Wechat
    1. Wechat groups and friend moments has valuable information 
    2. Contact friends, family, etc that are far away. 
    3. File sharing - nice to be able to send videos, pdfs, etc easily through the platform 
    4. Video calling feature
- Pretty good app - communication made very convenient 
- Visually - too many ads in moments, reels.
- Not too convenient to share information to people - need group to share to multiple people 
- Barely use any - almost no tiktok - kill time 
- Most valuable features - contact friends family - first reason to use it. Others are secondary, discovered after using it for primary reasons. 
- Other features - paying water bills, all kinds of bills, wallet, all very convenient, Would not prefer to separate - taxi 
- Little red book 
- convenient to check information 
- vacation guides, how to get visas, how to make food, etc. Nice to obtain valuable information. 
- Still becoming like tiktok which dont like. 
- How to open a coconut? So hard to open coconuts until searched on little red book. 


**Mr. Wasuwanich**

- Doesn’t use social media, does news count? 
- Use that as main source of info. Occasionally tune into Facebook - UPenn parent group, once a week kinda thing. 
- Line too. Line is prominent in thailand, use line to text family from thailand. They also post so once in a while can see updates on family and friends. Posts once a week, check every time he gets message. 
- Because of time difference between US and thailand (13 hours), early morning or late at night. 
- Facebook: don't really use because don’t know ppl on fb, also don’t care, too old for it. “When i look randomly, if i see interesting news I will forward the info to my kids.” 
- Facebook interface is decent, but too many ads and posts from mutuals that are irrelevant to me. 
- Adding too much - facebook dating, market place, messenger. 
- Line - only use for practicality (most used in SEA). Otherwise I can just use text messages or call. Why would when I have a phone to call people.  
- Practical purposes - Want to track all news, focus on close friends and family, don’t need reels / videos / distracting items. Distracting - shopping, ads
- News - prefer physical news paper but costs money to deliver - use wallstreet journal subscription - has financial information that i am interested in - less biased journal. Like flipping through newspaper - feels nostalgic
