# Project Phase 5 - Beta Release

## Design Revisions

**Removing Daily Streaks**: After evaluating the integration of daily streaks, we determined that they did not align well with our app's other motivational features. Streaks are typically effective for habit-forming apps but felt redundant given our robust scoring, leaderboards, and cosmetic rewards systems, which already drive user engagement and reinforce recycling habits. By focusing on these alternative motivational mechanisms, we avoid unnecessary overlap and ensure a streamlined user experience.

**Not Implementing Clubs**: While clubs were initially considered as a way to enhance social competition, they introduced unnecessary complexity that could overshadow the simplicity and effectiveness of the "friends" feature. Competing directly with friends creates a more personal and relatable dynamic, which we believe better aligns with users' motivations. By narrowing the scope to friends, we maintain the competitive spirit without overcomplicating social interactions within the app.

**Not Implementing Badges**: Badges were considered as a potential reward system but felt redundant alongside the garden feature, which already provides a meaningful and visually engaging way to track progress. Adding badges could create clutter and dilute the impact of our primary reward system. By focusing solely on the garden feature, we ensure a cohesive and satisfying user experience while maintaining a strong incentive for recycling.

**Points Do Not Reset**: The concept of resetting points weekly was intended to create a recurring competition. However, we found that this mechanic could disrupt the sense of cumulative achievement and potentially confuse users. By maintaining a persistent points system, users can focus on long-term progress and feel a stronger sense of accomplishment. This approach also better aligns with the overall design of the leaderboard, ensuring a smoother integration with the app's competitive aspects.

## Task List
| Title | Task Instruction | Task Rationale |
|-------|------------------|----------------|
| Classifying an item | Take a plastic water bottle and determine if it is recyclable, then find the nearest correct bin type to dispose of it. | This is the key functionality of our app so it is important that users are able to do it without problem. Because users would not have an existing mental model for this type of app, user testing will ensure that a new user unfamiliar with the app layout can nonetheless use the essential features. The task instructions are deliberately vague to avoid giving the user a preconceived notion of the structure of our app. |
| Friending        | Create an account, then make a few friends and see where you stand on the leaderboard. | Similar to the previous test, the wording is vague because this test looks for whether the process of friending matches the userâ€™s pre-existing mental model of friending. Walking through the feature ourselves gives us an understanding that each task is well signposted, but we need to know whether the structure is designed such that users without familiarity can accomplish the same tasks. This task is important because friends and the leaderboard are our main draw for encouraging users to recycle, so users need to quickly understand how to access this information. |
| Bin adding       | Find three recycling bins near your location and add them to the map.              | Our app will rely on crowdsourcing information for the location of trash and recycling bins, as that is not something we/developers can personally maintain. So the process of adding a bin needs to be simple enough for users to continue to do so. This test assesses whether the process of adding is simple for a new user, but more importantly looks for whether the process is pleasant enough for a user to continue to do many times over. This emotional aspect is why this user test is necessary. |
| Gaming           | Try to get enough points to reach the leaderboard podium!                          | Not only do we need to make sure our app is usable, but we also need to ensure our app gamifies recycling enough to promote the practice. This test serves two purposes: 1) making sure a user understands how to get points after executing the previous tests and 2) seeing if the process of competing on a leaderboard is exciting for the user. The second point makes this test especially important because new users need to want to use the app, which is an evaluation that merely walking through the app will not reveal. |
| Cosmetics        | Grow a few plants and arrange your garden as you want to.                          | Cosmetics are the primary usage of points, so users need to both know how to and want to purchase them. Similar to the previous test, this assesses whether the process of plants and cosmetics are intuitive enough for a new user to pick up on. In addition, as with the previous test, this test looks for whether the cosmetic purchase system is enjoyable to the user and would entice them to use our app. Again, this second point is why this is an important user test, because it requires the input of a new user. |
