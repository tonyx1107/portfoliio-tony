# Project Phase 2 - Divergent Design

## Broad Application Goals

### App Name: ReCycle

### Intended Audience

ReCycle targets people who want to recycle but do not know how to recycle items correctly and  people who do not recycle because they consider it too complicated or lack motivation.

### Value

Because of a lack of clear education on waste management, and varying recycling policies between local communities, people who might want to recycle either recycle incorrectly or do not recycle in the first place. Beyond education, existing recycling applications only fit specific use cases, such as targeting specific communities or requiring a barcode to scan. ReCycle aims to close the gap by bringing general utility, and helping people recycle more items in various locations.

## Scrapbook of Comparables

### Scrapp Barcode Scanner
<img src="./p2-images/scrap.jpeg" alt="Image" style="width: 40%; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"/>

Scrapp's barcode scanning feature allows users to identify recyclability by scanning a product’s barcode, simplifying the recycling process for items with packaging labels. While Scrapp’s feature is limited to items with barcodes, ReCycle’s camera scanning feature could improve on this by identifying any item using ML & AI, including those without barcodes—like apple cores, plastic utensils, or crumpled paper. This could improve the versatility of ReCycle to handle a broader range of waste items, enhancing user convenience by guiding correct disposal for nearly any material.

### Scrapp Personal Progress Tracker
<img src="./p2-images/tracker.jpeg" alt="Image" style="width: 40%; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"/>

Scrapp’s personal recycle history/progress tracking feature allows users to see their recycling habits over time, motivating them to recycle more consistently by providing insights into their efforts. This feature could inspire a similar feature in ReCycle, where users might track their own recycling achievements, get reminders, or even earn rewards for consistent recycling behavior. This kind of feedback loop could help engage users by making them feel accomplished, and fostering long-term habits of correct waste disposal.

### Yelp Restaurant Map
<img src="./p2-images/map.jpeg" alt="Image" style="width: 40%; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"/>

Yelp’s map of the nearest restaurants lets users quickly locate nearby dining options, enhancing convenience by visually displaying choices based on proximity. For ReCycle, a similar map feature could show the locations of nearby recycling bins, drop-off points, or waste sorting facilities, making it easier for users to find proper disposal sites in their area. This could be particularly helpful for items that require specialized recycling, such as electronics or hazardous materials, as well as places where recycling bins may not be as common or easily found.

### Shazam Song Identification
<img src="./p2-images/music.jpeg" alt="Image" style="width: 40%; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"/>

Shazam uses audio recognition to identify songs by analyzing and matching sound patterns. Similarly, ReCycle could use image recognition via the camera to identify waste items, helping users determine the correct recycling bin. Both apps simplify decision-making by providing a quick, intuitive solution to identify something specific—in ReCycle's case, which bin to use for disposal. This parallel could inspire ReCycle's interface design, focusing on a user-friendly way to capture and classify items with minimal steps.

### Brawl Stars Leaderboards
<img src="./p2-images/leaderboard.jpeg" alt="Image" style="width: 100%; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"/>

Brawl Stars’ global and regional leaderboards rank players by performance, adding a competitive and social element that motivates continued engagement. For ReCycle, a similar leaderboard could track users’ recycling contributions on local, regional, or global scales, encouraging friendly competition to recycle more and recycle correctly. This could help ReCycle users feel connected to a larger community goal, potentially sparking positive behavior change by showcasing users’ impact on waste reduction.

### MyNetDiary Calorie Tracker
<img src="./p2-images/score.jpeg" alt="Image" style="width: 40%; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"/>
 
MyNetDiary's daily calorie tracker encourages users to meet health goals by monitoring their food intake against a daily target, creating a clear, achievable objective. ReCycle could adopt a similar feature with daily recycling goals, where users track the items they recycle each day, working towards a set target. This daily goal system could keep users engaged and mindful about recycling, helping them build consistent habits while visually rewarding their progress and impact on reducing waste.

### Google Lens Image Recognition
<img src="./p2-images/ai.jpeg" alt="Image" style="width: 40%; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"/>

Google Lens allows users to identify objects, plants, animals, and more by analyzing an image 
through AI and machine learning. This object-recognition approach could be a useful model for ReCycle’s camera feature, allowing users to photograph waste items for classification. Like Google Lens, ReCycle’s interface could provide an immediate result with suggestions for proper disposal, enhancing usability and accuracy.

### Duolingo Daily Streak
<img src="./p2-images/streak.jpeg" alt="Image" style="width: 40%; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"/>

Duolingo’s daily streaks motivate users to practice consistently by rewarding consecutive days of engagement and building long-term habits through positive reinforcement. ReCycle could incorporate a similar streak feature, encouraging users to recycle correctly each day to maintain their streak. This could make recycling feel rewarding and fun, reinforcing consistency as users work to reach personal or community recycling milestones, ultimately fostering a habit of responsible waste management.

### Apple Health Weekly Summary
<img src="./p2-images/apple.png" alt="Image" style="width: 40%; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"/>

Apple Health provides a weekly summary of users' physical activity, showing trends, achievements, and goals met. A similar weekly recycling summary in ReCycle could give users an overview of their recycling patterns, like how much waste they’ve recycled, types of materials, and cumulative environmental impact. This feature could increase user engagement by making progress tangible and highlighting environmental contributions over time.

### League of Legends Achievement Badges
<img src="./p2-images/league.jpeg" alt="Image" style="width: 100%; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"/>

In League of Legends, players earn badges, titles, and player borders that can be used to customize their profiles, obtained via achievements like reaching certain ranks or mastering a character. Similarly, ReCycle could use achievement badges, titles, or profile borders to reward users for recycling milestones—such as consistently recycling daily, achieving a high ReCycle streak, or reaching a total item goal. These rewards could add a sense of progression and personal accomplishment, motivating users to keep recycling.

## Brainstorm of Feature Ideas

## Concept Outline

### Concept 1: Identifying
#### Purpose
Determining what an item is from a photograph of that item to decide if that item is recyclable or not
#### Operational Principle
A user provides a photograph of an item, such as an apple core, and receives an identification (“apple core”) of what that item is.  

### Concept 2: Classifying [Item]
#### Purpose
Determining if an item is recyclable or not
#### Operational Principle
A user provides an item. If the item does not need to be trashed, such as an apple core or a piece of paper, the user will receive a classification of where that item can be disposed (food waste, paper recycling). If the item is not recyclable, such as a used drink container, they will receive a classification that the item needs to be trashed.

### Concept 3: Locating [Item, Location]
#### Purpose
Determining where the nearest disposal bin is to a user
#### Operational Principle
After providing a waste disposal category and a current location, a user can retrieve the disposal bin of that category nearest to their current location

### Concept 4: Scoring [User]
#### Purpose
Evaluating how good a user is at recycling
#### Operational Principle
After creating a score for a user, that score can increase or decrease. When a user looks up their score, they will see the final value after all the modifications.

### Concept 5: Leaderboarding [User, Score]
#### Purpose
Ranking users based on how well they recycle
#### Operational Principle
Given a collection of users, a user can see a ranking of those users based on their current scores, with higher scores given higher rankings. A user can add or remove users from the collection to see different rankings.

### Concept 6: Reminding [User]
#### Purpose
Reminding users to recycle if they have not recycled recently
#### Operational Principle
After indicating a user, if a certain amount of time has passed since that user has last used the app, that user will require a reminder. If the user has used the app within the time frame, that user will not require a reminder.

### Concept 7: Friending [User]
\**Adapted from TA Review Session*\*
#### Purpose
Creating a relationship between two users
#### Operational Principle
After indicating another user, the current user can add the other user to their list of friends. After that other user is added, the current user can remove the other user from their list of friends.

### Concept 8: Grouping [User]
\**Adapted from TA Review Session*\*
#### Purpose
Creating relationships between friends in order to establish communities 
#### Operational Principle
After a user creates a group, until a user deletes the group, that user can add users to that group and remove currently added users from that group.

## Storyboard and Sketches

### Story 1: Waste Classification from Image

#### Motivation
Richard has some trash from eating at Dunkin Donuts and wants to recycle it. He doesn’t remember if his iced coffee cup is recyclable. He knows that nonrecyclable contamination can ruin the chances of all the items in the recycling bin from being recycled. Thus he doesn’t want to recycle it if it can’t be recycled.

<img src="./p2-images/sb1.jpeg" alt="Image" style="width:100%; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"/>

#### Notes on Brittleness/Unclear Areas
- What happens if there are multiple items in one photo?
- What if the app can’t decide if something is recyclable from the photo

### Story 2: Finding a Recycle bin
#### Motivation
Rhea printed out a lot of paper while studying for her 6.160 exam. She wants to recycle it but can’t find a bin.

<img src="./p2-images/sb2.jpeg" alt="Image" style="width:100%; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"/>

#### Notes on Brittleness/Unclear Areas
- When should the app ask for a user location? All the time? Just when looking at a map?
- What if the user doesn’t want to share their location? 


### Story 3: Competing on Leaderboard
#### Motivation
Tony’s friends want him to recycle more, but Tony hates the environment and doesn’t feel motivated to recycle.

<img src="./p2-images/sb3.jpeg" alt="Image" style="width:100%; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"/>

#### Notes on Brittleness/Unclear Areas
- How to promote recycling with leaderboards without promoting increased waste?
- Have a global leader or just show friends?
