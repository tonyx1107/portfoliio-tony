## Draft Impact Case
### Problem Statement
The problem of waste mismanagement, particularly in recycling, is critical in the context of accelerating global warming and environmental degradation. Many individuals are uncertain about which items are recyclable and how to dispose of them correctly. This confusion leads to contamination in recycling streams, reducing the overall effectiveness of recycling efforts. Misplaced recyclables can end up in landfills, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions, while incorrect disposal of non-recyclable materials into recycling bins can render large amounts unrecyclable.
### Proposed Solution
Our solution is to design an app called ReCycle that helps people determine if items are recyclable and provides guidance on recycling them properly. ReCycle will allow users to take pictures of items they want to recycle, and the app will give immediate feedback on whether the item is recyclable in their local area. Additionally, it will provide information on nearby recycling centers, appropriate recycling bins, and best practices for reducing contamination. If users create an account, they could also be given a recycling score and be able to add friends, maintaining a leaderboard-like system to encourage each other to recycle more.
### Justification
ReCycle leverages the accessibility of smartphones to provide immediate and localized recycling information, addressing a widespread pain point in waste management. ReCycle also encourages group recycling through trends similar to sharing fitness achievements like walking or running progress, encouraging a larger audience to use the app. In a digital age where information can be instantly disseminated, there is still a gap in public knowledge about proper recycling practices. By providing a convenient and intuitive tool, ReCycle empowers and motivates individuals to make informed recycling decisions, thereby reducing contamination and improving recycling rates.
### Measuring Impact
We could measure the app’s effectiveness by evaluating key metrics, such as:
- **User engagement metrics:** Track simple data like the total number of scans/searches users perform, which can show how often the app is being used.
- **User-reported behavior changes:** Include a quick, in-app survey asking users if they feel more confident about their recycling decisions or have changed their recycling habits since using RecycleApp.
- **Recycling quiz results:** Use short quizzes within the app to test user knowledge before and after using RecycleApp. Compare the results to measure improvements in understanding recycling rules.
- **Recycling point results:** Collect metrics on user recycling points to measure the increase in recycling and app usage when gaining points.
- **Feedback and satisfaction scores:** Collect user feedback on the app's usefulness and ease of use, along with a star rating system.

These metrics would help us determine if ReCycle successfully addresses the problem of recycling mismanagement and contributes positively to environmental sustainability.

## Research Findings
### Evidence Supporting and Refuting Our Impact
#### In Support
- Plastic recycling is extremely complicated. Any contaminated plastic can ruin the entire collection
- Some plastic is mislabeled– the US only recycles plastics #1 and #2, and numbers 3-7, which are still collected as “recyclable” end up being wasted
- Only a percentage of recyclable items end up being recycled. From an EPA study in 2018:
    - The majority (68%) of papers are recycled
    - Only a quarter (25%) of glass is recycled
    - Only 9% of plastics are recycled
#### In Refutation
- The amount of recycling has drastically increased since the EPA began tracking the measurement, from 6 percent of generated waste in 1960 to 32 percent in 2018. 
- The United States does not have the infrastructure to process recycling. All recycling programs occur on a local level, and those policies vary widely: what is recyclable in one area might not be recyclable in another.
- Communities have cut down on recycling programs because the cost of recycling has increased (see: lack of infrastructure to do so). It is much easier for some communities to send everything to waste instead of recycling.
### Gaps in Existing Solutions
Current solutions for recycling are a combination of policies for the infrastructure side and policies for the consumer side. Some cities implement laws to make recycling easier, such as banning single-stream recycling (which leads to contamination) in favor of separated recycling for paper, class, food waste, etc.

Local communities run education programs to teach people how to recycle properly, and many recycling bins have helpful signs to teach people what is recyclable in those bins. However, neither of these really help with the hassle of trying to recycle items to the correct bins:
- People still struggle with recycling the correct materials, as the statistics of recycling show
- Tools to help with the correct recycling of items, such as widgets that classify various items, are not the most intuitive to use and are not easily accessible when actually in the process of deciding what to recycle

## VSD Analysis
### Indirect Stakeholders (Prompt 2 of Stakeholders)
**Observation:** Indirect stakeholders may include employees who handle waste, such as dining hall employees who take out trash bags and garbage waste processing plant employees. These people’s work may be positively or negatively affected by how accurately people (including direct stakeholders of ReCycle) can identify if something is recyclable.

**Design Response:** This emphasizes the importance of accuracy in our app’s waste classification since there is a potentially widespread impact on people who do not even use the app. One way to improve ReCycle’s machine-learning-based waste classification is via users who can thumbs up or thumbs down a classification to let the app know if their classification was accurate or not. Users’ feedback on the accuracy of our app could be used in a feedback loop to continuously improve our model’s accuracy.

### Diverse Geographies (Prompt 1 of Pervasiveness)
**Observation:** Since waste classification is a globally pervasive problem, there may be users all around the world, including places where internet access, cellular service, or even lack of a camera on their mobile device.

**Design Response:** In order to make our app accessible to users with limited internet access, we can make ReCycle’s core waste classification feature available for offline use, with only the initial download of the app and other “non-essential” features (user feedback, updates/improvements to the model, etc) requiring the internet. To account for devices that may not have a camera, we could provide a voice input mode for accessibility. To account for devices that also may not have a microphone, we could provide a text input mode for accessibility.

### Accounting for Culture (Prompt 5 of Pervasiveness)
**Observation:** In certain countries, neighborhoods, or cultures, there may be less of an incentive or social expectation to recycle due to cultural differences. For certain places, recyclable bins or the option to recycle waste may be less publicly accessible.
**Design Response:** We could focus on expanding our map feature to allow people to more easily find the nearest recycle bin, incorporating GPS data from the user’s device for pathfinding. If the user is not in a place with accessible recycling (due to social expectations, infrastructure reasons, etc), alternative solutions can be recommended by the app (composting, reusing).

### Adaptation (Prompt 3 of Time)
**Observation:** Frequent users of ReCycle may develop a habit of using their phone during recycling, potentially increasing overall screen time. This could impact users' digital well-being, making them feel inclined to spend more time on their mobile devices.

**Design Response:** ReCycle can employ a minimalistic, straightforward UI that prioritizes quick interactions, allowing users to complete recycling tasks without lingering. This design approach minimizes distractions, helping users avoid unnecessary screen time once they’ve completed their recycling activity.

### Environmental Sustainability (Prompt 4 of Values)
**Observation:** The ReCycle app serves to improve environmental sustainability by spreading awareness and educating people on recycling by making proper waste management/classification a convenient and fun thing to do. Note that the impact on environmental sustainability is not just a value but a core objective of the ReCycle app, so we must ensure that our app maximizes the improvement of people’s ability to classify waste, as well as inform on the importance of recycling to cultures where it may not be valued as heavily.

**Design Response:** Our app’s UI/UX must emphasize the positive benefits that people bring to the world by recycling properly, making recycling and waste classification satisfying and rewarding. Such ways of rewarding or incentivizing people include a leaderboard that tracks people who have recycled the most, as well as other metrics, such as how accurately a user can classify waste. Regional leaderboards may also be insensitive to more recycling among cultures or places where there might be less societal expectation when it comes to recycling and environmental sustainability.

## Summaries of Interview Key Lessons
### Interview 1: Expert Environmental Scientist
Chloe, a student studying Environmental Science, engages in consistent recycling practices and eco-conscious behaviors in her daily life. She recycles paper and cans regularly and has a compost bin in her dorm. Chloe also avoids driving, opting to walk instead, aligning with her environmental values. Since moving into her own space, she has become even more diligent in recycling, stating:

> “Now that I determine how all my waste is disposed of and I have less waste, it’s easier to sort.”

This quote underscores how autonomy over waste management has made her recycling efforts more streamlined. With fewer items to sort, she can be more intentional about disposal, leading to a heightened sense of control and responsibility.

Despite her efforts, Chloe is aware of the larger issues surrounding recycling and the common misconceptions that accompany it. She expressed frustration with the false sense of hope that recycling can sometimes create, particularly with respect to plastic use:

> “Recycling gives us this false sense of hope. People assume that if something is recyclable, it’s always going to be recycled. But that’s just not the case.”

Chloe’s comment reflects the broader issue of overconfidence in recycling systems, which can lead to increased plastic consumption under the assumption that all materials will be processed. She further clarified that many people are unaware of what can actually be recycled, particularly when it comes to plastics. She noted:

> “Most people think all plastic is recyclable, but in most counties, only rigid, solid plastics can be processed. Things like loose plastics, cellophane, or items tainted by food waste can’t be recycled.”

This statement highlights the significant gap in public knowledge about recycling rules, which can result in contamination and inefficient recycling processes. Chloe’s observation about how people often misjudge recyclability touches on a key challenge: the need for more widespread education about recycling materials, particularly when it comes to plastics and contamination.

Chloe also discussed the challenges she faces when trying to understand recycling guidelines, particularly the difficulty in reading the numbers on the bottom of plastic bottles:

> “It's difficult to read the numbers on the bottom of bottles, which makes it hard to know what’s actually recyclable.”

Her frustration points to a larger issue with how recycling information is presented to the public. The difficulty of identifying recyclable materials, especially with unclear or hard-to-read symbols, adds an unnecessary barrier to effective recycling. This reinforces the need for clearer, more accessible information that can guide individuals in making more informed decisions about what to recycle.

Further, Chloe proposed that recycling centers should improve communication about their accepted materials:
> “It would help if recycling centers published more specific information about what they can take.”

This suggestion highlights the importance of transparency in waste management, which could alleviate confusion and prevent contamination in the recycling stream. Chloe’s call for clearer guidelines and better labeling is a practical step toward improving recycling efficiency.

Chloe emphasized that she always errs on the side of caution when it comes to recycling, ensuring that items are "100% recyclable" before disposal:

> “I make sure to put things in the bin only if I’m sure they’re recyclable. I know for certain that paper and cans will be recycled.”

Her careful approach reflects a conscientious attitude toward waste disposal, indicating that Chloe places a high value on ensuring her actions align with her sustainable goals. This caution also speaks to a larger theme of personal responsibility in waste management, where individuals are expected to navigate complex and often confusing recycling systems with minimal guidance.

When Chloe is uncertain about whether an item is recyclable, she turns to Google for answers:

> “If the information isn’t the first result, I’ll just give up.”

This statement illustrates the challenges of accessing reliable recycling information. The reliance on internet searches also suggests that there’s a need for more efficient, centralized resources that provide clear answers for users who want to engage in responsible recycling practices but are often frustrated by the lack of immediate, reliable guidance.

Chloe’s interview offers a nuanced view of the complexities involved in individual recycling efforts. While she is committed to reducing waste and being environmentally conscious, she faces several challenges, such as the lack of clear recycling guidelines and widespread misconceptions about what materials are recyclable. Her frustrations with the inconsistency of recycling systems reflect a broader societal issue that often leaves individuals to navigate the complexities of waste management on their own. Chloe’s experiences highlight the importance of education, clear communication, and accessible tools to empower people to make informed decisions about recycling. Additionally, her emphasis on personal responsibility and caution in sorting recyclables speaks to a broader desire for individuals to contribute positively, even when the system around them is imperfect. 

### Interview 2: Stakeholder House Manager
Matthew, the house manager of New Vassar, engages in dedicated recycling practices and promotes sustainability through various efforts. To reduce waste, he uses reusable items like towels instead of paper towels, and often aims to purchase products in bulk to minimize plastic usage. Matthew follows proper recycling protocol by ensuring materials are clean and correctly sorted and sends regular emails to residents encouraging them to recycle, conserve energy, and maintain cleanliness. He highlights that a major motivation for recycling is to prevent landfill buildup and environmental pollution. As the manager explains:

> “Landfill buildup is a big concern for me—recyclable materials often don’t get processed correctly, which leads to unnecessary pollution of natural environments.”

Despite this dedication, Matthew finds many common misconceptions within the community, particularly the belief that all plastic is recyclable. He clarifies that even recyclable materials, like plastic, require certain conditions (such as being free of food or drink residue) to be processed properly. When these requirements aren’t met, contamination often makes entire bins of recyclable material unusable. 

Matthew also discusses the importance of visible examples in teaching recycling habits. He believes that schools, parents and other educational sources play a vital role in creating good recycling habits from a young age. 

> “If it becomes a community routine, people will obviously recycle more often and correctly”. 

For students who are unsure about recyclability, he advises quick internet searches, which are typically fast and informative.

When asked about the specific recycling issues in Vassar, Matthew named the dining hall as an example. The dining hall recycling bins frequently get contaminated with food waste, rendering the entire bin unrecyclable. In trash rooms, there is also a common assumption that soft plastics, like bags and wraps, are recyclable when they are not. The manager explains that convenience is a significant barrier—if trash disposal is easier, students tend to skip recycling, especially when items need to be cleaned. He noted:

> “If it’s easier to throw items into the trash, people will choose the quickest option. Recycling requires a bit more effort, and even small obstacles can discourage students.”

This statement highlights the impact of convenience on recycling behaviors, underscoring the importance of accessible, clear recycling instructions. Matthew also mentions that while Students respond well initially to posted recycling signs, they tend to revert to old habits if recycling isn’t part of their routine. This cycle of “reminding and forgetting” is a common pattern, emphasizing the need for consistent reinforcement of recycling practices to help students develop lasting habits.

Matthew’s interview emphasizes the need for accessible guidelines, convenient recycling options, and routine education to foster effective recycling. This approach, they suggest, could help break the cycle of “reminding and forgetting,” and help sustain our environment. 

### Interview 3: Stakeholder Well-Educated Everyday User
This participant, who chose to remain anonymous, is a young professional living in an urban area. She is environmentally conscious and values responsible waste management, though she isn’t an expert on recycling specifics. She tries to recycle correctly but finds that the complexity of recycling rules often leaves her uncertain. 

> “I want to recycle right, but sometimes it feels like a guessing game.”

Despite her intentions, she struggles with items like plastic packaging and coated paper products, where it’s unclear if they are recyclable. She emphasized her frustration with unclear labeling, explaining, 

> “Sometimes I’m holding something, wondering if it’s recyclable, and I just wish there was an easy way to find out.”

In terms of app features, she would appreciate a simple, accurate way to classify items instantly. She suggested that an app with image recognition could streamline the process: “If I could snap a photo and get an answer right away, that would make recycling so much easier.” She also expressed interest in a location-based feature, given the variation in recycling rules across cities. 

> “What’s recyclable here isn’t necessarily the same as where I grew up. It would be amazing if an app could adjust for that.”
	
Beyond basic sorting, she values education on the environmental impact of recycling and would like the app to provide insights on how to reduce waste, not just recycle it. She explained, 

> “Recycling is great, but I’d also love to know what I can do to cut down on waste altogether.”

This interview highlights the potential for an app that offers quick, clear classification along with educational content. Features like image recognition and location-specific guidance could meet this user’s needs while empowering her with the knowledge to make more sustainable choices.

### Interview 4: Stakeholder Ignorant Everyday User
This participant has chosen to remain anonymous. He is a college student in the greater Boston area, does not actively engage in environmentally conscious behaviors, and gives little thought to whether he is recycling correctly. 

> “I have never encountered an opportunity to engage in environmental conservation.” 

This perspective reflects a gap in both environmental awareness and motivation, as he generally disposes of items with minimal consideration.

> “I just throw everything into the recycling bin if it looks like it.” 

The participant routinely throws plastic food containers into recycling without knowing if they’re accepted. Lacking confidence in his own decisions, he sometimes checks the contents of nearby bins to see what others have discarded, using it as a guide to determine if he’s disposing of items correctly.

Although he occasionally notices signs on bins to aid in classification, he finds the recycling symbols on plastics confusing and largely ignores them.

> “I have no idea what the different types of plastic (#1, #2, etc) should be recycled or not.”

This highlights a widespread issue with public recycling knowledge and suggests a need for clear, accessible education on material types to prevent contamination in recycling streams.

This interview reveals an opportunity for an app that simplifies waste sorting for users like this participant. By providing straightforward, visual guidance on recyclable materials and educating users on environmental impacts, the app could help bridge gaps in knowledge and encourage more responsible waste management behaviors.

## Revised Impact Case
### Problem Statement
The challenge of waste mismanagement, specifically in recycling, exacerbates environmental issues like greenhouse gas emissions and pollution, compounding global warming and ecosystem degradation. Miscommunication and lack of clear recycling guidelines lead to contamination in recycling streams, where non-recyclable materials compromise the recyclability of large amounts of waste. According to recent interviews and research, a significant portion of the public remains uncertain about what items are recyclable or how to prepare items for recycling. For example, our interviews show that many assume all plastics can be recycled, while in reality, only specific types—often only types #1 and #2 in the U.S.—are processed. Improperly sorted waste and contamination render much of it unusable for recycling, contributing directly to landfill accumulation and unnecessary environmental damage.

### Proposed Solution
ReCycle is an app designed to help users determine if items are recyclable, providing tailored, localized guidance to improve recycling accuracy and reduce contamination. Users can open the ReCycle app and point their phone at an item, then the camera will scan the item and identify its recyclability based on the user’s location, accounting for local guidelines and varying recycling capacities. The app will also provide information on nearby recycling centers, appropriate bins, and best practices. To encourage consistent use and recycling habits, users can create accounts, track a recycling score, and join a social leaderboard where friends can motivate each other to recycle more frequently. This game-like system aims to make recycling not only accessible but also engaging, leveraging social motivation to promote environmental responsibility.

### Justification
The ReCycle app leverages advances in image recognition and smartphone accessibility to address a major gap in public knowledge about recycling. Interviews with environmentally conscious individuals reveal a recurring frustration with the lack of clear, accessible recycling guidelines and the misconception that all plastics and materials are recyclable. For example, people struggle to decipher recycling symbols and numbers on plastic items, which hinders their ability to recycle responsibly. Moreover, statistics from the Environmental Protection Agency underscore that only 9% of plastic and 25% of glass are effectively recycled, indicating widespread public misunderstanding of what constitutes recyclable materials.

Through a simplified interface and localized advice, ReCycle addresses the specific obstacles identified in the research and interviews, such as complex recycling labels and varying local rules. Additionally, the app’s social features encourage users to recycle together, similar to fitness apps that track and share exercise achievements, creating a community around responsible waste management. By offering immediate, location-based information and positive reinforcement through social connectivity, ReCycle addresses the identified behavioral and informational barriers to effective recycling.

### Measuring Impact
To assess ReCycle's effectiveness and societal impact, the following key metrics are proposed:
- **User Engagement Metrics:** Track the number of scans or searches users perform daily, weekly, and monthly. Higher engagement rates can indicate the app’s usefulness in users’ daily lives.
- **Waste Classification Feedback:** Users can rate the accuracy of ReCycle’s waste classification, with the user feedback data being fed back to our model for continuous and automatic improvement in accuracy.
- **Behavioral Change Reports:** In-app surveys will periodically ask users whether they feel more confident about their recycling decisions or if their habits have changed since using ReCycle. This self-reported data will help gauge the app’s impact on users' behavior.
- **Recycling Score Metrics:** Track users' recycling scores to assess the app’s effectiveness in promoting increased and accurate recycling. This metric can also reveal user engagement with the app’s social features and leaderboard.
- **User Satisfaction and Feedback:** Regular feedback collection will provide insights into the app's usability and effectiveness. Ratings and reviews will help identify areas for improvement and guide future updates.

Together, these metrics will illustrate whether ReCycle has effectively addressed the recycling mismanagement problem and contributed to broader sustainability goals by reducing contamination and improving recycling rates.
